*The good bits:*
Native to the foothills of Arkansas' Ozark Mountains. My life consists of... my wife (Kristin), my daughter (Faye), my dog (Ollie), herping, hiking, swimming and canoeing, woodworking, and home DIY projects.

*The serious bits:*
I am a landscape ecologist, with interest in research at the interface between conservation, ecological theory, and mathematical modeling. I primarily work with reptiles and amphibians, but am interested in the processes determining the distribution of biodiversity more broadly.
