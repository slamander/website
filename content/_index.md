      title: "Teaching & Mentoring"
      text: |

        Whether in a classroom or lab, teaching must be student-centered, holistic, and equitable. By  fostering a supportive, engaging environment and recognizing all of studentsâ€™ needs  (educational, emotional, and biological), I empower students to demonstrate mastery or seek additional support as neededâ€”an approach known to increase success and enhance well-being.

        ## Teaching Philosophy

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          <div>
            <h3>Teaching Philosophy: </h3>
            <p> 
        Evidence-based strategies: 

         - inquiry-based learning through real-world problem-solving

         - hands-on, experiential activities (in the classroom, lab, or field)

         - active learning exercises (e.g., case studies and debates)

         </p>
        </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Mentoring Philosophy:</h3>
            <p>

         Key practices:

         - align studentsâ€™ academic progress with personal goals and well-being

         - foster independent problem-solving by providing space to explore and reflect

         - encourage outside collaboration and/or mentorship

         </p>
        </div>
        </div>

         ## Student Outcomes
        My students have gone on to pursue careers in academia, state/federal agencies, and the private sector:
        - **Career progression:** 7 students pursued or completed MS (5) and PhD (2) programs and credit my mentorship in shaping their career trajectory
        - **Academic output:** 15 conference presentations, 2 undergraduate theses, and 4 peer-reviewed publications
