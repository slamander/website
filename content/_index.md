      title: "Teaching & Mentoring"
      text: |

        I believe education must be student-centered, holistic, and equitable. By fostering a supportive, engaging environment and recognizing all of studentsâ€™ needs  (educational, emotional, and biological), I empower students to demonstrate mastery or seek additional support as neededâ€”an approach known to increase success and enhance well-being.
