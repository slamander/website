      title: "Teaching & Mentoring"
      text: |

        > "Whether in a classroom or lab, teaching must be student-centered, holistic, and equitable. By  fostering a supportive, engaging environment and recognizing all of studentsâ€™ needs  (educational, emotional, and biological), I empower students to demonstrate mastery or seek additional support as neededâ€”an approach known to increase success and enhance well-being ([Kaput 2018](https://www.educationevolving.org/resources/evidence-for-student-centered-learning))."

        ## Teaching Philosophy

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          <div>
            <h3>Teaching Philosophy: </h3>
            <p> 
        I employ the following evidence-based strategies: 

         - inquiry-based learning through real-world problem-solving

         - hands-on, experiential activities

         - active learning exercises (e.g., case studies and debates)

         </p>
        </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Mentoring Philosophy:</h3>
            <p>
         I prioritize three key practices:

         - regular check-ins to align studentsâ€™ academic progress with their personal goals and well-being

         - fostering independent problem-solving by giving students space to explore, make mistakes, and reflect

         - encouraging external mentorship, whether within the lab (through peer or cascade mentoring) or from additional faculty mentors

         </p>
        </div>
        </div>

         ## Student Outcomes
        My students have gone on to pursue careers in:
        - **Career progression:** 7 students now in MS (5) and PhD (2) programs and credit my mentorship in shaping their career trajectory
        - **Academic output:** 11 conference presentations, 1 undergraduate thesis, and 4 peer-reviewed publications
