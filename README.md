## Welcome

Hi everyone, 

My name is Alex Baecher, I'm a postdoc fellow at Utah State University with the Clark-Wolf lab and Stuber lab (USGS). 

### Research interests
I am an ecologist, with training in herpetology and landscape ecology, and I have an interest in research at the interface between conservation, ecology theory, and mathematical modeling. 

Hopefully you'll find some of the items on my github and website interesting or useful. Please contact me either directly through github, or through my website. 

Cheers, 

-Alex.
