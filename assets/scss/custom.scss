Hi Claude, 
I have a hugo website that I have recently updated from hugo academic to hugo blox, so there may be many artifacts of a recent configuration. However, in my content/_index.md , I have a landing page with a "hero" block that serves as a banner across the top of my page. The banner  image is very zoomed in, and I've tried resizing the image and adjusting the padding, but the banner is never the size I want. I would like a shape that fits the relative dimensions of the image, and so I think I need to get a hero widget that can resize based on the dimensions of the device viewing the webpage. Is there a way to work towards that? Starting with getting the image to at least fit in the screen without being so tall and cut off width ways?

Edit
You're dealing with a common issue when migrating from Hugo Academic to Hugo Blox - the hero block styling often needs adjustment. Let me help you create a responsive hero section that properly fits your image dimensions.

Here are several approaches to fix your hero block:

1. CSS Override Method (Recommended)
Create or modify your assets/scss/custom.scss file (or static/css/custom.css if you prefer) with these styles:


Custom Hero Styles
Code 
2. Update Your _index.md Configuration
Modify your hero block configuration in content/_index.md:


Hero Block Configuration
Code 
3. Image Preparation Tips
To get the best results:

Optimize your hero image dimensions: Use images with a 16:9 or 21:9 aspect ratio for wide screens
Recommended sizes: 1920x1080px or 2560x1440px for high-resolution displays
Format: Use WebP format if possible for better performance, with JPG fallback
4. Alternative: Custom Hero Partial
If you need more control, create a custom hero partial at layouts/partials/blocks/hero.html:


Custom Hero Partial
Code 
Quick Fix to Try First
Start with method #1 (the CSS override). Add those styles to your custom CSS file and adjust the max-height value until it looks right on your device. The object-fit: cover property will ensure your image scales proportionally without distortion.

Troubleshooting
If you're still having issues:

Check your Hugo Blox version - newer versions may have different class names
Inspect element in your browser to see the actual CSS classes being applied
Try different object-fit values: contain (shows full image), cover (fills container), or fill (stretches to fit)
Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions, or do you need help identifying the specific CSS classes your Hugo Blox theme is using?

Thank you! I realize now that I forgot to include an attachment of my github repository that contains my website. Could you check that the code works for this configuration?

Edit
Perfect! Now I can see your specific Hugo Blox setup and the issue. Looking at your content/_index.md and assets/scss/custom.scss, I can see you're already using the custom-hero class, but the current CSS isn't quite achieving the responsive behavior you want.

Let me update your custom.scss file to fix the hero section sizing:


Updated Custom SCSS for Hero Block
Code 
Now, let me also suggest a small update to your _index.md hero block configuration to ensure it works optimally:


Updated Hero Block Configuration
Code 
Key Changes Made:
Responsive Height: Used clamp(250px, 50vh, 500px) which means:
Minimum height: 250px
Preferred height: 50% of viewport height
Maximum height: 500px
Better Object Fitting: Added multiple selectors to catch different ways Hugo Blox might structure the background image
Mobile Optimization: Added responsive breakpoints with smaller heights and font sizes for mobile devices
Flexbox Centering: Ensures content is properly centered vertically and horizontally
Background Attachment: Set to scroll for better mobile performance
To implement:
Replace your assets/scss/custom.scss with the updated version above
Update your hero block in content/_index.md with the refined configuration
Test the changes by rebuilding your site (hugo server)
Troubleshooting:
If you're still seeing issues:

Check browser dev tools to see which CSS classes are actually being applied to your hero section
Try adjusting the clamp() values - you can change 50vh to 40vh or 60vh to make it smaller or larger
Verify your image path - make sure log_extended_resized.png is in your static/media/ or assets/media/ folder
The clamp() function will automatically adjust the hero height based on the device's screen size while respecting your minimum and maximum bounds, which should solve the "too tall and cut off" issue you're experiencing.

Would you like me to help you adjust any of these values or troubleshoot further once you've implemented the changes?




The Netlify build sent this error, which started at the block code:

Edit
I can see the error is likely related to the YAML formatting in the hero block configuration. The issue is probably with the indentation or the css_style block. Let me provide a corrected version that should work with your Hugo Blox setup.

Looking at your current _index.md, I notice you already have a working hero block configuration. Let's keep most of your existing structure and just make minimal changes:


Updated Hero Block Configuration
Code ∙ Version 2 
I removed the css_style block which was likely causing the YAML parsing error. The CSS styling should be handled entirely through your custom.scss file.

For your _index.md file, use this exact hero block configuration:

yaml
  - block: hero
    content:
      title: "Baecher Research"
      text: "Spatial ecology and conservation research"
      cta:
        url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zADCDlIiJlx1vXKQ6NdMLwTZm7E6sS29/view?usp=sharing"
        label: Download CV
        icon_pack: fas
        icon: download
    design:
      background:
        image:
          filename: log_extended_resized.png
          filters:
            brightness: 0.6
        position: center
        size: cover
        text_color_light: true
      spacing:
        padding: ["20px", "0px", "20px", "0px"]
    css_class: custom-hero
This keeps your existing working structure and just relies on the updated CSS in your custom.scss file to handle the responsive sizing. The CSS file I provided earlier should handle all the styling adjustments you need.

Try this version and let me know if the build succeeds!




I'm sorry, I hit respond before pasting the error message from netlify, here is the AI diagnosis and response:

Diagnosis: The build failure is occurring because of an error in processing a Markdown file within the content directory.

Solution: The error is related to unmarshaling YAML in the _index.md file. To resolve this issue, verify the YAML syntax in the _index.md file at the specified line (line 20) and fix any syntax errors present in the YAML front matter. Once the syntax issues are corrected, trigger the build again to ensure it completes successfully.
Edit
Thank you for providing the error details! The issue is definitely with YAML syntax in your _index.md file around line 20. Looking at your current file, I can see a few potential issues that could cause YAML parsing errors.

Let me provide you with a corrected version of your _index.md file with proper YAML formatting:


Corrected _index.md with Fixed YAML
Code 
Key YAML fixes made:
Added quotes around "Download CV" in the CTA label (line ~26)
Added quotes around empty title in the social links markdown block (line ~37)
Ensured consistent indentation throughout
Added quotes around archive text values where needed
Fixed any potential spacing issues
Most common YAML issues around line 20 are:
Missing quotes around strings that contain special characters
Inconsistent indentation (YAML is very strict about this)
Missing colons or extra spaces after colons
Unescaped special characters in strings
Replace your current content/_index.md with the corrected version above. The YAML should now parse correctly and your Netlify build should succeed.

If you still get an error, the issue might be with invisible characters. You could also try:

Copy the content exactly as provided above
Check that your text editor isn't introducing any invisible characters
Make sure there are no tabs mixed with spaces (use only spaces for indentation)
Let me know if this resolves the build error!




Thank you!! That improved the fit of the hero image, but it is still too zoomed in. I provided a very wide image to make the hero banner thin (horizontally). Is there a way to make sure it fits closer to the dimensions of the image, or should I tune the dimensions of the hero banner to better fit the image? I can also provide the dimensions of the image if it helps.

Edit
Great! The YAML fix worked. Now for the image fitting issue - this is a common problem with hero banners. The best approach depends on your image dimensions and what you want to achieve.

Could you share the dimensions of your log_extended_resized.png image? (width x height)

In the meantime, here are a few CSS approaches we can try:

Option 1: Use object-fit: contain (shows full image)

Updated Custom SCSS for Hero Block
Code ∙ Version 2 
Option 2: Dynamic height based on image aspect ratio
If your image is very wide (like 3:1 or 4:1 ratio), we can calculate a height that maintains the image proportions:


Aspect Ratio Based Hero CSS
Code 
Option 3: Very thin banner approach
If you want a very thin banner that respects your wide image:


Thin Banner Hero CSS
Code 
What to try:
First, try Option 1 (changing cover to contain) - this will show your full image without cropping
Share your image dimensions so I can calculate the exact aspect ratio
Tell me your preference: Do you want a thin banner or would you rather see the full image?
Quick questions to help me give you the perfect solution:
What are the pixel dimensions of your log_extended_resized.png?
Do you want a very thin banner (like 150-200px tall) or are you okay with taller if it shows the image better?
Is the image designed to be cropped, or do you want to see the whole thing?
Once I know your image dimensions, I can give you the exact CSS that will make it look perfect!




Yes! Of course! The hero image is 3008px by 534px (width by height).

Edit
Perfect! Your image has approximately a 5.6:1 aspect ratio (very wide and thin), which is exactly what you want for a banner. Let me create the ideal CSS for this specific image:


Updated Custom SCSS for Hero Block
Code ∙ Version 3 
What this CSS does:
calc(100vw / 5.6) - Calculates the height based on your image's exact 5.6:1 aspect ratio
Max height of 300px - Prevents the banner from being too tall on large monitors
Min height of 120px - Ensures text remains readable on small screens
Responsive breakpoints - Adjusts the ratio slightly on mobile for better usability
Two options for you:
Option A: Use the main CSS (recommended)
This will show much more of your wide image while maintaining good proportions across devices.

Option B: Perfect fit with no cropping
If you want to see your entire image with zero cropping, add this class to your hero block:

yaml
css_class: custom-hero exact-fit
Expected results:
Desktop (1920px wide): Hero will be about 240px tall (showing your full image width)
Tablet (768px wide): Hero will be about 170px tall
Mobile (375px wide): Hero will be about 94px tall
This should give you a beautifully proportioned banner that respects your wide image design. The text and button sizes are also optimized for the thinner banner format.

Try this and let me know how it looks!
