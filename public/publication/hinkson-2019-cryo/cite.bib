	abstract = {Global amphibian declines have fueled an increased interest in amphibian assisted reproductive technologies. Within the genus Rhaebo, half of the species are experiencing decreasing population trends; however, insuffcient information is available on many of these species’ reproductive biology. Using the smooth-sided toad, Rhaebo guttatus, we present eﬀective methods for collecting and cryopreserving an example of Rhaebo sperm. Speciﬁcally, our ﬁndings show that administering 10 IU/g body weight of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) yields the most motile and concentrated sperm and that cryopreserving spermic urine in a solution of 5\% DMFA (N,N-Dimethylformamide) and 10\% trehalose returns sperm with a 33 ± 3\% average post-thaw motility. These ﬁndings may represent an important step forward in developing techniques that can be safely applied to other, more vulnerable species within the Rhaebo genus.},
